    A comma separated list of triggers (TriggerCauses) to blacklist. It is necessary to specify the full class names
    including the package for the blacklisting to work.<br />
    When specified, tasks triggered by the blacklisted triggers won't be scheduled by Jenkins.<br /><br />

    The blacklist defaults to <b>hudson.triggers.TimerTrigger$TimerTriggerCause</b> and
    <b>hudson.triggers.SCMTrigger$SCMTriggerCause</b> if left blank.
